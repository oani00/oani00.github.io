What is the best strategy for studying before a quiz or exam? A partial answer to this question comes from a research study comparing three different strategies (Weinstein, McDermott, & Roediger, 2010). In the study, students read a passage knowing that they would be tested on the material. In one condition, participants simply reread the passage. In a second condition, the students answered prepared comprehension questions about the material, and in a third condition, the students generated and answered their own questions. The results showed that answering comprehension questions significantly improved exam performance but it did not matter whether the students had to generate their own questions.
